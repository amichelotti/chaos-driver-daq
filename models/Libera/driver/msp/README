MSP - MSP GNU/Linux device driver for libera
Copyright (C) 2004-2006 Instrumentation Technologies

You will need a __configured__ kernel source tree in order to compile the 
MSP GNU/Linux device driver properly. Only extracting the kernel sources 
won't do the job, because the driver needs to know about certain configuration 
items, such a module versioning, SMP settings etc.
You have been warned!
Make sure the whole kernel source tree is readable for the user that is 
building the module. If unsure, build the msp module as root.


1. BUILDING
To build the MSP GNU/Linux device driver, type

  cd src
  make

This will build the msp.o module for the running kernel version. The kernel 
version is obtained by searching the Linux kernel source tree in the 
following order:
  /usr/src/linux
  /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
  /usr/src/linux-$(shell uname -r)
  /usr/src/linux-$(shell uname -r | sed 's/-.*//')
  /usr/src/kernel-headers-$(shell uname -r)
  /usr/src/kernel-source-$(shell uname -r)
  /usr/src/linux-$(shell uname -r | sed 's/\([0-9]*\.[0-9]*\)\..*/\1/')


If you choose your own kernel, either set the KERNELDIR variable in 
Makefile to your kernel path or specify it on the command line:

  KERNELDIR=/path/to/my/super/kernel  make

When cross-compiling, either set the toolchain prefix (CROSS_COMPILE) in 
the Makefile or on the command line:

  CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- make

The log verbosity can be set through DEBUG variable:

  make DEBUG=2

The following debug levels are supported:
  DEBUG=0 - Only critical warnings are reported.
  DEBUG=1 - Warnings are reported especially the results of
	    sanity checks.
  DEBUG=2 - Informative messages are reported, including 
	    variable values, register values etc. All while loops
	    are protected and cannot run infinitely to avoid machine lockups.
  DEBUG=3 - Messages when entering and leaving certain sections,
	    interrupt handlers, tasklets and triggers are reported.
  DEBUG=4 - The whole bus activity is logged (every read and 
	    write FPGA operation), but this poses a severe
	    overhead as well.

Every debug level includes the messges from the previous debug level
plus additional information that increases the verbosity level.

To install the MSP GNU/Linux device driver, type
  make install

To install the MSP GNU/Linux device files, type
  make devices


2. LOADING
Load the Libera GNU/Linux device driver by typing (as root)
  insmod msp
or
  modprobe msp


2.1 MODULE PARAMETERS
The following module parameters can be specified when loading the module:

  iobase  - Base address of Libera device (default = 0x14000000).
  gpio    - GPIO number used for interrupt, GPIO=IRQ-1 
	    (default: GPIO=1 -> IRQ=2).

You can make the MSP GNU/Linux device driver module to load on demand by
adding this to your /etc/modules.conf file:

  alias char-major-241 msp

The module parameters can be specified by adding:

  options msp <param>=<value>

See modules.conf(5) man page for details.
